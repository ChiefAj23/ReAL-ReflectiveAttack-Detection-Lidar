## Overview
This repository contains code for the paper **ReAL**, focusing on detecting reflective surface interference in LiDAR readings. Our approach employs a machine learning-based system for real-time detection of reflective interference on resource-constrained devices.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ChiefAj23/ReAL-ReflectiveAttack-Detection-Lidar.git
cd ReAL-ReflectiveAttack-Detection-Lidar
```
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Requirements
Python 3.7+
Jetson Orion Nano (for resource-constrained testing)
LiDAR sensor (RPLiDAR A1M8-R6 recommended)
Make sure to set up the hardware and sensor according to the manufacturerâ€™s guidelines.

Usage
To begin detecting reflective attacks on LiDAR data:

Set up the LiDAR sensor and prepare your testing environment using requirement.txt
Run the detection command with preprocessed LiDAR data:
```bash
python detect_reflective_attack.py --input data/lidar_data.csv --model checkpoints/svm_model.pkl
```
This command initiates real-time interference detection using the specified model and input dataset.

## Dataset
We used RpLidar to collect and gather data can be found in the folder Data.

## Experiments
We conducted controlled experiments to assess the accuracy and response time on reflective surface detection. The repository includes configurations for replication or further experimentation.

See experiments/README.md for setup details.
